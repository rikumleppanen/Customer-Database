## Description



Application is designed for marketing people who need to maintain a customer database and take lists of customers.


## Draft Pages

### Alert! Only list of customers and customers' pages are working properly: adding new customers and consent attributes, modifying and destroying the existing ones. I am going to create a new features: tables to add Order(s) to customers (as to replace the current situation that consents are more like attributes within Customer than separate (N-to-N) table in database. Firstly, I considered Consents as N-to-N table but they are more like attributes so new feature as N-to-N is needed.)
